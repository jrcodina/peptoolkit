Description: A toolkit designed for the manipulation and 
    analysis of peptides. The package provides a range of functionalities aimed 
    at assisting researchers in peptide engineering and proteomics. The package 
    allows users to manipulate peptides by adding amino acids at every position, 
    count the occurrences of each amino acid at each position, and transform 
    amino acid counts based on probabilities. Additionally, the package offers 
    functionalities to select the best versus the worst peptides and further 
    analyze these peptides. This includes counting specific residues, reducing 
    peptide sequences, extracting features through One Hot Encoding (OHE), and 
    utilizing Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) properties. 
    This package is intended for both researchers and bioinformatics enthusiasts 
    who are working on peptide-based projects, specially for their use with 
    machine learning.
