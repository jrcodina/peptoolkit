\title{Extract One-Hot Encoded (OHE) Features from Peptide Sequences}
\usage{
extract_features_OHE(
  df = NULL,
  sequence_col = "Sequence",
  docking_col = NULL,
  n = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame or a vector of peptide sequences. If 'df' is provided, 'n' will be ignored.}

\item{sequence_col}{A string representing the name of the column containing the peptide sequences.}

\item{docking_col}{A string representing the name of the column containing the docking information.}

\item{n}{An integer representing the length of the peptide library to be generated. If 'df' is provided, 'n' will be ignored.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing one-hot encoded peptide sequences and, if provided, docking information.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame or a vector of peptide sequences and generates
a one-hot encoded data frame representing each amino acid in the sequences.
It can also include additional data (such as docking information), if provided.
Furthermore, it can generate a peptide library of specified length n.

# Load required library caret
